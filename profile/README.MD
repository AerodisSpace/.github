# Aerodis Space: Advanced FPV Video and Sensor Data Streaming Platform

## In-Depth Overview

Aerodis Space is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize how we interact with drones and model aircraft, enabling live streaming of FPV (First Person View) video and real-time sensor data transmission. Beyond being a powerful tool for the agricultural sector, its versatility makes it ideal for applications in environmental monitoring, infrastructure inspection, public safety, and scientific research, opening a range of possibilities for the exploration and analysis of aerial data.

## Basic Features:

### Enhanced Cross-Platform Accessibility
Desktop and Mobile Integration: Aerodis Space provides a comprehensive experience across both desktop and mobile platforms. On the desktop application, users have the full suite of functionalities including live streaming access, real-time data visualization, and detailed setup configurations for their aircraft models. The mobile application offers streamlined access to viewing streams and monitoring flight data, ensuring users stay connected wherever they go.

### Sophisticated Data Management
Seamless Data Export to CSV: Aerodis Space enhances its data storage capabilities by introducing a feature that allows users to automatically generate and continuously update CSV files with sensor data in real-time. This functionality empowers users to effortlessly capture and analyze flight data, facilitating a deeper understanding of each flight session.

### Sensor-Only Data Transmission for Pre-existing Aircraft
Integration with Commercial Drones: Tailored for enthusiasts who already own a commercial drone, such as a DJI model, Aerodis Space offers a unique solution that bridges the gap between proprietary systems and open-source flexibility. Users can attach a microcontroller equipped with sensors and a radio module to their drone, transforming it into a transmitter. On the ground, a separate microcontroller acts as a receiver, capturing the transmitted data and seamlessly feeding it into the Aerodis Space system for real-time analysis and storage. This innovative approach allows drone owners to enhance their existing models with advanced sensor capabilities without the need for complex modifications, opening up new possibilities for data collection and analysis.
